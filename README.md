Please use the Data.xlsx file to investigate the effect of independent variables (price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size) on the price of a high-floor, spacious 2-bedroom house with a spectacular view, available at an affordable price. The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no significant effect of the independent variables on the price. The alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is a significant effect of the independent variables on the price. The objective is to test this hypothesis using the provided data in the "Data" Excel file.
 
Selection of Confidence Level: A 95% confidence level is chosen to determine the range within which the true parameter value is likely to fall. A 95% confidence interval covers 95% of the normal curve, meaning that there is a 5% probability of observing a value outside of this range.

 Statistical Test or Model: To test the hypothesis, a multiple regression analysis is conducted. This analysis helps determine the relationship between the dependent variable (price) and the independent variables (price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size).

Solution
=
"5% probability of observing a value outside of the confidence interval or 95%confidence

FLOOR_SIZE:
The very low p-value (1.7487E-272) for FLOOR_SIZE indicates that this variable is highly statistically significant. There is strong evidence to suggest that the floor size has a significant effect on the house price.

NO_OF_BATHROOMS:
The p-value (0.043845756) for No. of Bathrum is less than 0.05, suggesting it is statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. There is also evdience that it is significant

PRICE_SQFT:
The extremely low p-value (5.8314E-293) for PRICE per sqft indicates that this variable is highly statistically significant. There is strong evidence to suggest that the price per square foot has a significant effect on the house price."
